#Webcam Whack-A-Mole
## Overview
This is a game developed as a capstone project by four senior computer science students at the University of Nebraksa at Omaha. We are trying to create a proof-of-concept for using a hand gesture captrue by a webcam which can sense the depth of the hands moving towards and away from the sensor. Future applications will further develop the proof-of-concept if successful to create VR like controls without requiring individuals to hold. This is for accessibility features for people with disabilities or rehabilitating.

## Explanation
Our simple application is a simple game of whack-a-mole with six controls needing hands to play. Currently, it does not work, but soon it will.

## Release Notes: 2/28/2027
Milestone 1 - we have a couple of libraries which capture the up, down, left, and right movements including MediaPipe Hands and a existing project template of the same library with modifications.
Milestone 2 - Partially complete now. We have partially built the whack-a-mole game but have more features, animations, and art to implement. We will finish by 3/12/2026
Milestone 3 - Upcoming, we will fully integrate our gameplay with the hand gestures.
