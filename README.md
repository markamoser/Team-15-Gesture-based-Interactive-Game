#Webcam Whack-A-Mole
## Overview
This is a game developed as a capstone project by four senior computer science students at the University of Nebraksa at Omaha. We are trying to create a proof-of-concept for using a hand gesture captrue by a webcam which can sense the depth of the hands moving towards and away from the sensor. Future applications will further develop the proof-of-concept if successful to create VR like controls without requiring individuals to hold. This is for accessibility features for people with disabilities or rehabilitating.

## Project Progress
We track progress by creating story points with Trello, communicating over discord or during class in our zoom breakout sessions, we store our repository on this public GitHub page, and we keep our journals, and other class documentation on a OneDrive page created by the project lead.

## Branches
Mark's demo is on the twohandtest-backup brank
John's demo is on the John branch
Ben's demo is on the Ben branch
The main branch currently has Ben's game before he incorporated the hand capture library

## Release Notes: 2/28/2027
Milestone 1 - we have a couple of libraries which capture the up, down, left, and right movements including MediaPipe Hands and a existing project template of the same library with modifications.
